MULTITHUMB_DESCR=<h2>What is BK-Multithumb:</h2><p>BK-Mltithumb plugin is inherited from Martin Larsen's Multithumb for Joomla 1.5.<br /><br />For details about  BK-Multithumb read here:</p><p><a href="http://joomla.rjews.net/bk-multithumb" target="_blank" >http://joomla.rjews.net/bk-multithumb</a></p> <h2>About Multithumb for Joomla 1.5 read here:</h2><a href="http://www.kreacom.dk/mambots/multithumb-for-joomla-15.html" target="_blank">http://www.kreacom.dk/mambots/multithumb-for-joomla-15.html</a> <h2><strong>What is Multithumb?</strong></h2> Multithumb is a multi-purpose image plugin for Joomla that can automatically create thumbnails and popups of the original images, as well as resize the full-size images or add a watermark to them. It can even scramble the images names so that people cannot guess their original non-watermark locations.  <p>For articles shown in blog mode, it can create a link from the first image to the full article for better user navigation.</p> <p>It can also create a simple photo gallery from any folder by just including one of the images from the folder and give it the description (alt text) "mt_gallery" (or using the new tagging feature).</p> <p>Multithumb works with both normal images and {mosimage} images.</p> <p>See the examples and how-to's below for inspiration and instructions!</p> <p>Please note that when you use Multihumb for the first time on a given page, the server has to process all the images which might take quite some time. The same applies when you clear Multithumb's cache.</p> <h1>Here is a list of some of the new features in Multithumb 2.0:</h1> <ul> <li> <ul> <li><strong>Watermarks</strong><br /> Supports both popup images and images shown in content Watermark images can be true alpha blend PNG images or any GIF, JPG og PNG image with manually set transparent background color<br /> User definable watermark position</li> <li><strong>Language packs</strong><br /> Installable language packs for Multithumb's frontend</li> <li><strong>Manual thumbnails</strong><br /> You can create your own thumbnails and let :mt use them instead </li> <li><strong>Thumbnail proportions</strong><br /> Choose between best fit (keeping aspect ration), crop to fit, fill out with background color, stretch (distort proportions)</li> <li><strong>Scrambled image names</strong></li> <li><strong>Automatic resize of images</strong><br /> Can resize both popup images and images shown in content<br /> Resize by pixels or percentage of screen size</li> <li><strong>New popup types: Slimbox, Greybox and Thickbox<br /> </strong>Multihumb now supports six popup types: normal, lightbox, slimbox, greybox, thickbox, thumbnail expansion<br /> Thumbnail expansion now works perfect with captions too! </li> <li><strong>"Intelligent" handling of compatibility issues with other javascript libraries</strong><br /> For example, if mootools.js is already included in your template, Multithumb will not try add it again</li> <li><strong>Auto-gallery with individual image descriptions</strong><br /> You can add a text file with the same name as the image used for the gallery, and :mt will use the content of this file for image descriptions<br /> It will even create the description file for you, ready to fill out!</li> <li><strong>Link to main article in blog mode</strong><br /> Instead of showing a popup when viewing the article in blog mode, :mt can create a link from the first image to the main article.<br /> Or it can just create a plain, inactive thumbnail</li> <li><strong>Works from sub folders out-of-the-box</strong><br /> You no longer have to modify the javascript files if you run Joomla from a sub folder on the server</li> <li><strong>Native thumbnail generation</strong><br /> :mt no longer uses an external thumbnail library</li> <li><strong>Informative error handling with javascript popup messages</strong><br /> Like if :mt can't find the watermark file, or if the server does not support the needed image functions </li> <li><strong>Extremely configurable</strong><br /> But because of that, also a bit confusing for new users :-)</li> <li><strong>Parameter override, allowing for multiple configurations even in same article</strong><br /> Most of :mt's settings can be overridden in the content by including the proper tags, like:<br /> {:multithumb popup_type=greybox full_width=400}  which will make Greybox the new popup style and images 400px wide<br /> The override works until the end of the article or until it is overridden again.<br /> <em> There is even a handy online tool dedicated to creating the tags for you!</em></li> <li><strong>Many new options</strong></li> <li><strong>Backend much better arranged</strong> </li> <li><strong>Improved and optimized code</strong></li> </ul> </li> </ul>
